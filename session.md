# Session - Fixing Catastrophic Refactor Damage

## CRITICAL: Development Server Info
**PORT: localhost:3002** - Server is already running and managed by user
**NEVER START A SERVER** - The dev server is already running on port 3002
**FOR TESTING**: Always use localhost:3002 - it's already up and running

## Current Active Problem
We refactored the 1700+ line monolith to avoid coding errors, but in the process we completely broke core functionality and introduced massive bugs. This is a complete disaster.

**UPDATE: FIXED NEXT.JS BUILD CORRUPTION**
- Deleted corrupted .next directory 
- Rebuilt successfully - app should start now
- Next.js bootstrap error was due to corrupted build cache

**READY FOR TESTING**: App should now load on localhost:3002 (once you restart your dev server)

## What's Actually Broken Right Now (Not Working)

### 1. Basic Message Sending - COMPLETELY BROKEN
- **Status**: Messages don't even show up when sent
- **Error**: `HTTP 500: Internal Server Error` from useMessaging.ts:294
- **Impact**: Core functionality is dead - can't send any messages at all
- **Location**: useMessaging.ts:155 in sendStreamingMessage function

### 2. Scroll Position Memory - COMPLETELY BROKEN  
- **Status**: Switching between sessions always jumps to top
- **Expected**: Remember scroll position per session
- **Actual**: Always scrolls to top, never remembers anything
- **Impact**: Unusable UX when managing multiple conversations

### 3. Session Status Indicators - MISSING
- **Status**: All per-session indicators are gone
- **Missing Features**:
  - Loading spinners beside session buttons (when Claude is thinking)
  - Ready/thinking status per session
  - Last interaction timestamps
- **Location**: Session sidebar (left panel)
- **Impact**: No way to see which sessions are active/processing

### 4. Session Isolation - BROKEN
- **Status**: Sessions don't work independently 
- **Issue**: Processing in one session blocks all sessions
- **Expected**: Each session should work independently

## Technical Debt from Refactor

### Files That Got Fucked Up
- `useMessaging.ts` - HTTP 500 errors, broken message sending
- `useSessionManager.ts` - Scroll position save/restore not working
- Session sidebar components - Missing all status indicators
- Message display - Messages not appearing

### What We Lost in Refactor
1. **Working message sending** (now returns 500 errors)
2. **Scroll position memory** (completely non-functional)
3. **Session status indicators** (visual feedback gone)
4. **Per-session timestamps** (removed during refactor)
5. **Session isolation** (all sessions block each other)

## Next Steps
1. Use Playwright MCP to document the actual broken state
2. Fix HTTP 500 error in message sending (priority 1)
3. Rebuild scroll position memory system
4. Restore session status indicators
5. Fix session isolation

## Reality Check
This refactor was supposed to make the code more maintainable but instead created a completely broken application. We need to acknowledge this disaster and systematically rebuild the missing functionality.
