So I anyways I just I' not gonna use that one. I' just gonna stick with ours and then I. And then I created a new holler session named Yep. And it is so anyways I I I sent a test message and then I sent and then I immediately put it into Jarvis mode and I saw that the file updated so that it knew it was in planning mode, it was in Jarvis mode., it was it even came up with a plan, but there's no evidence of it ever trying to of us trying to capture the last message. So our last message capturing logic still just isn't it's not there. and it looks like you're running my server now, or somehow you're running the server. So anyways, you're gonna have to stop and restart the server every time you make a change because I think that's how that server works right now. But anyways, yeah that's the current situation and I' looking to have a debugging buddy. So let's let's just debug, you know, in a really smart way, in a way that you can really help me, because I can't really look at the screen much right now, but maybe if you can you know include some debugging logs in the server in a in really crucial spots and I want you to ultra think about this. I want you to put c really smart console logs in it in the server code and potentially in the front end code such that you can easily find them. And I want you to debug in a way that tells you what parts are working and what parts aren't, you know, just seeing how far things are getting. And then and then maybe we can stop and restart the server and then you can go ahead and maybe then I can run a test for you and then you can look into the logs and see why things are or are not working.

I want you to put c really smart console logs in it in the server code and potentially in the front end code such that you can easily find them. And I want you to debug in a way that tells you what parts are working and what parts aren't, you know, just seeing how far things are getting.

So our last message capturing logic still just isn't it's not there. and it looks like you're running my server now, or somehow you're running the server. So anyways, you're gonna have to stop and restart the server every time you make a change because I think that's how that server works right now. But anyways, yeah that's the current situation and I' looking to have a debugging buddy. So let's let's just debug, you know, in a really smart way, in a way that you can really help me, because I can't really look at the screen much right now, but maybe if you can you know include some debugging logs in the server in a in really crucial spots and I want you to ultra think about this. I want you to put c really smart console logs in it in the server code and potentially in the front end code such that you can easily find them. And I want you to debug in a way that tells you what parts are working and what parts aren't, you know, just seeing how far things are getting. And then and then maybe we can stop and restart the server and then you can go ahead and maybe then I can run a test for you and then you can look into the logs and see why things are or are not working.

So I anyways I just I' not gonna use that one. I' just gonna stick with ours and then I. And then I created a new holler session named Yep. And it is so anyways I I I sent a test message and then I sent and then I immediately put it into Jarvis mode and I saw that the file updated so that it knew it was in planning mode, it was in Jarvis mode., it was it even came up with a plan, but there's no evidence of it ever trying to of us trying to capture the last message. So our last message capturing logic still just isn't it's not there. and it looks like you're running my server now, or somehow you're running the server. So anyways, you're gonna have to stop and restart the server every time you make a change because I think that's how that server works right now. But anyways, yeah that's the current situation and I' looking to have a debugging buddy. So let's let's just debug, you know, in a really smart way, in a way that you can really help me, because I can't really look at the screen much right now, but maybe if you can you know include some debugging logs in the server in a in really crucial spots and I want you to ultra think about this. I want you to put c really smart console logs in it in the server code and potentially in the front end code such that you can easily find them. And I want you to debug in a way that tells you what parts are working and what parts aren't, you know, just seeing how far things are getting.
